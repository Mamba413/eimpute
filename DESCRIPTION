Description: Efficiently impute large scale matrix with missing values via its unbiased low-rank matrix approximation. Our main approach is Hard-Impute algorithm proposed in <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/mazumder10a.html>, which achieves highly computational advantage by truncated singular-value decomposition.
